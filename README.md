Linebot test and practice.
Because of my environment can't run requirements.txt
when I have Pipfile and Pipfile.lock two files,
so these two files rename become xxPipfile and xxPipfile.lock.
They don't be used by Heroku deploy, only requirements.txt could run.
Here is incomplete code, so if you want to run successfully, must be modify some code.
